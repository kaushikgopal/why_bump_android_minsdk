You should always keep bumping your minSdk version for the Android app. Newer API levels (OS versions in Android) come with more fixes and features that you can start using. But if you're required to make that case, this document should help.

What you get:

__Features:__

Android Studio currently already provides a neat listing (with a picker and all) everytime you create an Android Studio project. For the lazy, i'll include a screenshot from each of those APIs.

If there's a feature not on that list, that you think is worth calling out, send a PR and we'll add it here!

__Bugs:__

Sometimes there are terrible bugs/limitations with OS versions (or the phone manufacturer variant of that OS). If you notice these and want to make the world for AndroidDev better, send a PR and we'll add it here!

__Features that are not user facing:__

There are programmer facing features like language features (Lambdas, method references, try with resources) that are hugely critical for developers. These are usually not called out in that new Android Studio project creator listing. If you know of these and want to make the lives of other AndroidDev better, send a PR!

![api 19 features](img/api_19_k.png "API 19 features")

* Chromium based WebView, which is still a WebView..., but far less horrible, fragmented and vulnerable compared to the WebViews before 4.4.
* "Lossless" WebP support. Actually [lossless was made available in API 18](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/convert-webp.html) but [when those in the know were asked for suggested minSdk (for WebP), they suggested 19](https://twitter.com/Eric_Cochran/status/855446820708679680).
* Java 7 [try-with-resources](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36999599#comment3)

![api 17 features](img/api_17_j.png "API 17 features")

* Samsung __bug__ with RTL (you need to have some padding on everything, otherwise Samsung will blow up cause they overrode or had their own version of rtl before Android had it built in?). Listen to [this Fragmented episode with Dan Lew](fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/049) where he talks about it.
* [WebP support](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats.html) (but not lossless, see note in API 19)
* `Location` objects send back [elapsed realtime nanoseconds](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#getElapsedRealtimeNanos()) (this is important for getting the "age" of the location fix)

![api 16 features](img/api_16_j.png "API 16 features")
